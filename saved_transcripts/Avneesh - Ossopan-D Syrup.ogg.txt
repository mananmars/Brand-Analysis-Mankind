Good morning sir. I am Avnish from Itawa Headquarter.  Sir, today I have called Dr. C.S. Chaudhary and P.K. Chaudhary and promote my brand Osopandi.  And I have told them about the absorption of MCSC that is 96%.  And sir, then doctor told me that a brand came from Lupin named Lupin's Almighty Plus.  Contains Algas Calcareous along with Vitamin D3 and Curcuma Longa.  They are claiming that the highest absorption is more than 90%.  Sir, please look into it and validate whatever they are claiming.  And please provide some knockout point against Algas Calcareous.  Thank you so much.
